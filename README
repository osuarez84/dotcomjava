This is a sample project using Java. It is the DotComGame in which three dotcom are deployed in a 7x7 grid, give them some alphanumeric coordinates and then ask for the user to introduce coordinates using the console. The aim of the user is to sink the three dotcoms. 

When the three dotcoms are sunk the game ends and the program makes an evaluation based on the number of attemps.
